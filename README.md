#Front-end Tester

Quick and dirty front-end interviewing app built using Backbone and Require.js.

### Motivation
Preparing for front-end interviews involves potential questions in a number of different areas. To prepare for this situtation appropriately, it is important to practice answering these questions eloquently.

While there are great lists of questions out there, I wanted something which would replicate the peer-revision process of asking one-another questions at random.

Original questions extrapolated from [_Front-end Job Interview Questions_](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions).

While I have answered these questions to the best of my ability, there are probably cases where I am incorrect, or the answer can be improved (feel free to let me know!).

In many cases, the answers here were informed by a number of resources; far too many to list.
